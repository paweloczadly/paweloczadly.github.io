## HRT principle

> Humility - You are not the center of the universe. You’re neither omni- scient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement.

> Respect - You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as human beings, and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.

> Trust - You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.
