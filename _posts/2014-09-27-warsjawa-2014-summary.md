## General

Conference was great. Bigger than year ago. Workshop topics were very interesting. The variety of topics was reach. Starting from programming languages Java/Scala/Groovy through soft presentations and ending on Devops issues Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Docker.

People also were open and willing to talk on different topics.

I like this form of the conference. I had possibility to learn something new and interesting. Moreover, when I requested for help, the speaker always helped me.

Fingers crossed for the next edition! :)
